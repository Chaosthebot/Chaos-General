## Code of Conduct
Chaos and everyone contributing to chaos are governed by the [__Chaos Code of Conduct__](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please open an issue with the [COC Violation] tag to have `Chaos` trigger an investigation. _subject to change_ 

## I just have a question!
If the question doesn't have to do with any design or feature decision to be made, the best place to ask it would be in the [Chaos gitter](https://gitter.im/chaosthebot). Most of the contributing team is on there available to answer your questions.


## What should I know before I get started?

### Chaosbot
Chaosbot was the brainchild of [@amoffat](https://www.github.com/amoffat) and has grown thanks to the hard work of dozens of contributors. It is currently being reimagined from the ground up in order to better handle the influx of contributions and pull requests, and the problems which existed with the bot's behavior that were revealed by the flurry of activity.

### Modules
Chaosbot is separated into many different modules based on language, behavior, and scope:

| Module                                       | Language             | Function                                                      |
|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| __[Chaos-General](/../../../Chaos-General)__ | N/A                  | The repo which holds documentation and other general info     |
| __[Chaos-Core](/../../../Chaos-Core)__       | Javascript (Node.js) | The core self-maintaining functionality of `Chaos`            |
| __[Chaos](/../../../Chaos)__                 | (Mostly) Python      | The legacy repo. No longer monitored or maintained by `Chaos` |

### Design Decisions
TODO: Certain design decisions were made. Which ones will be here.

## How can I contribute?
TODO: Explain how Chaos works here. This will be more relevant once we have the core and democracy modules up and running.
